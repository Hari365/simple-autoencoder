# simple-autoencoder
A simple autoencoder using Tensorflow.
In classic machine learning, we use techniques like PCA(principal component analysis) and SVD(singular value decomposition) to obtain most informative directions from our data. The same can be done using Deep learning by an unsuperwised learning algorithm.
My implementation was inspired by this article http://ufldl.stanford.edu/tutorial/unsupervised/Autoencoders/
